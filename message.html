                My name is Faith, also known online as Itzlazzzy. My life has been a mix of challenges, doubts, and self-discovery. On this page is where I express my past <span id="years"></span> years from the moment I was born.

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>Hong Kong</h3>
                I grew up in Hong Kong, a densely populated city located at the south of China. The food in Hong Kong is delicious and I promised myself if I ever go back to Hong Kong, the first thing I will do is to buy a lot of food and eat. 
                <h3>kindergarten</h3>
                In my memory, the earliest thing I could remember is at kindergarten.
                My memory about this part was quite blurry, so I mainly just remember that I got really angry, and I tried flip over a table inside the classroom. 
                As expected, the teachers tried to stop me.
                <br><br>
                One interesting memory is that I was walking in the corridoor, and for some reason I bump into the wall and hit my nose. As I feel the pain, I saw blood comes out my nose. 
                I wasn't freaked out or anything, but it was my first time having a nose bleed (And last, I have never had another nose bleed after that.), so I kinda got excited about it and rush into the bathroom to get tissue only to get told off not to run.
                <br><br>
                Do I trust myself's memory? To be honest, No. But I do think that it went the way it is.
